Combine all of the ingredients, kneading to form a smooth dough.\u003C/p\u003E, \u003Cp\u003EAllow the dough to rise, in a lightly greased, covered bowl, until it\u0027s doubled in size, about 90 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E, \u003Cp\u003EGently divide the dough in half; it\u0027ll deflate somewhat. Preshape each piece of dough by pulling the edges into the center, turning it over so the seam is on the bottom, and rolling under your cupped hands to form a ball. Let the dough rest, covered, for 15 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E, \u003Cp\u003ETo make fat oval loaves, elongate each ball of dough you\u0027ve preshaped by gently rolling it back and forth on an unfloured work surface several times. For longer loaves, continue rolling until they\u0027re about 10\u0022 to 11\u0022 long.  \u003C/p\u003E, \u003Cp\u003EPlace the loaves on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
